    <h3>Here's my story....</h3>
   <section>
    <p>
        As I was studying biology, I had to take a course where I had to code to complete a lab experiment. 
        It was incredibly intimidating for my class and I because nobody had any coding experience. 
        Everyone struggled. I remember dropping everything I was doing to figure out how to code. 
        It was a frutrating process, but very satisfying to see what code can do. 
        At that moment, I fell in love with coding. 
        This is a passion that I knew I had to explore further, so I decided to do just that. 
        Since then, I became obsessed with the recent web development trends. 
        Whenever I visit a new website, I always stop to look at how everything is working. 
        I knew I had to pursue web development as a career.

        I shifted my interest from biology to web development. 
        When I started taking courses, I remember being the only female in one of my classes. 
        In my first group project, I was also the only female in a group of six. 
        It turns out women only make up about 25% of computing roles. 
        Despite the pattern, I am more determined than ever to make a difference in the technology industry.
        Together, we can work on bridging the gender gap.
        I hope I can be the success story to empower more women to join the technology industry.
