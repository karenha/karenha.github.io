## Welcome to Karen's Sample Project Site

**Hello, nice to meet you all!**

My name is Karen, and I am an aspiring web developer! I am a pun/wit/humor enthusiast, curious explorer, and a superhero lover.

When I worked in a lab and had to code to sort organisms, I absolutely fell in love with coding and even went on to help the rest of my lab mates. This experience combined with my cybersecurity studies abroad at Cambridge made me realize that there is so much room to grow in the technology field. I am a late bloomer, but I am still excited to be part of it. 

Hope everybody is staying healthy, safe, and positive during this time. 

Thanks for dropping by!
