## Welcome to Karen's Sample Site

**Hello, Nice to Meet You All!**

My name is Karen, and I am an aspiring web developer! I am a pun enthusiast, curious explorer, and a superhero lover.

When I worked in a lab and had to code to sort marine microorganisms, I absolutely fell in love with coding and even went on to help the rest of my labmates when they struggled. This experience, combined with my cybersecurity studies abroad at the University of Cambridge, made me realize that there is so much room to grow in the technology field. Just like a superhero, I want to make the world a better place with one website at a time. 

I love to play around with the following programming languages during my free time:

- Python
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- PHP
- SQL

Hope everybody is staying healthy, safe, and positive during this time. 

Thanks for dropping by!
